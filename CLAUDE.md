# RunDom – iOS Project Guide

## Project Overview

RunDom (user-facing brand: **Runpire**) is a gamified running app where users conquer real-world territories on a map by running through them. It is NOT a fitness tracker — it's a competitive, territory-based game that uses GPS running as its core mechanic.

> **Branding note:** The Xcode project, bundle ID, and source folder are named `RunDom`, but the app's display name and all user-facing copy use **Runpire**. Keep codebase identifiers as `RunDom`; only surface `Runpire` in localized strings, splash, share cards, and brand chrome.

> **Currency naming:** The in-game currency is called **Points** (English) / **Puan** (Turkish) in all user-facing copy. Internal code identifiers still use `trail` (e.g. `totalTrail`, `TrailCalculator`, `currentSeasonTrail`, `run.trailEarned` localization key). Don't rename code symbols — only the localized strings say "Points / Puan".

**Core loop:** Run → Conquer territories → Earn Points → Compete on leaderboards → Defend your zones

## Architecture Guidelines

### Code Standards
- All code in Swift
- All comments in English
- SwiftUI for all UI
- Follow MVVM pattern
- Use Swift Concurrency (async/await) where applicable

### Localization
- Supported languages: Turkish (`tr`), English (`en`)
- Device language = Turkish → app in Turkish; all others → English
- Runtime language switching via `LocalizationManager` (ObservableObject)
- All strings via `Localizable.strings` — never hardcode user-facing text
- Currency unit (user-facing): "Puan" (tr) / "Points" (en) — keys: `trail.unit`, `trail.points`
- Avatar messages, notifications, badge names, weekly reports — all localized
- Date/time/number formats follow device locale

### Units (km / mi)
- `UnitPreference` (ObservableObject, singleton) toggles between metric and imperial.
- Stored in `UserDefaults` under `AppConstants.UserDefaultsKeys.unitPreference`.
- Helpers: `distanceValue`, `speedValue`, `paceValue`, plus localized `*UnitLabel` keys (`unit.distance.km` / `unit.distance.mi`, `unit.speed.kmh` / `unit.speed.mph`, `unit.pace.km` / `unit.pace.mi`).
- Internal calculations (Trail, anti-cheat, territory) always operate in metric — convert at the view layer only.

### Theme
- Support both Light and Dark mode
- All colors via SwiftUI `Color` system + Asset Catalog with per-theme definitions
- `Color+Hex` extension for hex-string colors stored on the user (territory paint color)
- Prefer system colors where possible

### Design Standards
- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines (HIG)
- Use SF Symbols for all icons
- Prefer native SwiftUI animations
- Smooth transitions (0.3s or less)
- Bold typography, high contrast
- Generous spacing and padding
- Every screen must have empty state design

## Game Systems

### Territory System
- Map divided into H3 hexagonal cells (resolution `9`, see `AppConstants.Location.h3Resolution`)
- Running through a cell conquers it (painted in user's color)
- Another user running same cell takes it over
- More distance in a cell = higher defense level = harder to capture
- 48 hours without running in a cell → defense level decays
- Anti-farming: low multiplier for running in small repeated areas
- When a user loses a cell, a `TerritoryLossEvent` is written to Firestore and surfaced via `TerritoryLossPromptSheet` / `TerritoryLossMapBrowserBar`

### Season System
- Weekly seasons, reset every Monday 00:00 UTC
- All territories reset at season start

### Points Formula
> User-facing label: "Points / Puan". Code identifier: `trail` (e.g. `TrailCalculator`, `totalTrail`).

```
Points = (Base × Speed × Duration × Zone) × Streak × Mode × Anti-Farm
```
- **Base:** distance(km) × 100
- **Speed multiplier:** min(avgSpeed / 10, 1.8) — min threshold 4 km/h (`Game.minSpeedKmh`), cap at 18 km/h
- **Duration multiplier:** min(1.0 + (minutes / 100), 2.0) — caps at 120 min
- **Zone multiplier:** min(1.0 + (newZones × 0.1), 2.0) — caps at 10+ new zones
- **Streak:** 3d→x1.2, 7d→x1.5, 14d→x2.0 — missing 1 day drops one tier (no full reset)
- **Mode:** Normal=x1.0 (guaranteed), Boost=x2.0 (drops to x1.0 if avg speed < 7 km/h)
- **Anti-Farm:** unique zones ratio >70%→x1.0, 40-70%→x0.7, <40%→x0.4
- **Caps:** Max 5,000 per run, 15,000 per day (constants still named `maxTrailPerRun` / `maxTrailPerDay`)

### Player Level System
- `PlayerLevel` (model) derives level from total accumulated Points.
- Threshold to reach level *N*: `250 · N · (N - 1)`. Gap between consecutive levels: `level · 500`.
- `LevelBreakdownView` (Profile) shows current level, progress to next, and span.
- Level-up celebration uses `level_up.json` Lottie.

### Boost Mode Speed Indicator
- Selection screen: show 7 km/h threshold clearly
- During run: live speed with color coding (green=safe, yellow=approaching, red=below threshold)
- Post-run: average vs threshold comparison, clear boost active/cancelled status

> **Removed: Dropzone System.** The dropzone feature has been retired from the product. The map no longer shows dropzone annotations and there is no spawn / claim flow. Some legacy code still lives in the repo (`Models/Dropzone.swift`, `Services/Game/DropzoneService.swift`, `Features/Map/Views/DropzoneAnnotationView.swift`, `Features/Map/Views/DropzoneDetailSheet.swift`, `dropzone*` keys in `AppRouter` / `MainTabView` / `MapViewModel`, plus `dropzone.*` localization keys) but it is dead — `MapTabView` now passes `dropzones: []` and `onDropzoneTapped: nil`. Treat it as removed when designing new features; clean up the leftovers when convenient.

### Daily Challenge System
- Daily rotating challenges with difficulty tiers (easy/medium/hard)
- Challenge types: distance, speed, territory, duration, zone variety
- Template-based with localized descriptions
- Bonus Points rewards based on difficulty
- Surfaced in `DailyChallengeSelectionView` before runs, progress tracked per run
- FCM topics per language (`daily_challenges_en`, `daily_challenges_tr`)

### Badge System
- 12 badges across categories: Performance, Territory, Exploration, Streak (the original Dropzone-tier badges are now legacy and not awarded)
- Rule-based auto-evaluation via `BadgeService` after each run
- Badge catalog seeded on first login
- Some badges are hidden/secret

### User Color
- Auto-assigned at registration — user cannot choose
- Used for territory painting on map and as widget accent

### User Model
- Include `isPremium: Bool = true` flag (everyone gets true for now)
- No StoreKit integration — monetization deferred

## Run Voice Feedback

- `RunAudioService` (singleton, `AVSpeechSynthesizer`) announces each kilometer with current pace.
- Toggle: `AppConstants.UserDefaultsKeys.voiceFeedbackEnabled` (default ON).
- Localizes voice + spoken text by `LocalizationManager.selectedLanguageCode` (Turkish vs English).
- Respects `UnitPreference.useMiles` to announce miles instead of kilometres when enabled.

## Run Gallery & Share Cards

- `RunGalleryMapSnapshotter` renders the run's polyline on a `MKMapSnapshotter` snapshot.
- `RunGalleryPhotoLibrarySaver` saves to the user's photo library (requires `NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription`).
- `RunSummaryShareRenderer` + `PostRunShareCardView` produce a branded share image (Runpire watermark).
- `RunGalleryView` lists past run snapshots; `RunReviewSheet` collects rating/notes after a run.
- `ShareSheet` is the SwiftUI wrapper for `UIActivityViewController`.

## Widgets (RunDomWidget extension)

Two widgets, both reading from the App Group `UserDefaults`:

| Widget | Data model | UserDefaults key |
|--------|------------|------------------|
| `RunDomWidget` (weekly summary) | `WeeklySummary` (totalTrail [= weekly Points], totalDistanceMeters, runCount, streakDays, userColorHex) | `AppGroup.weeklySummaryKey` ("weeklySummary") |
| `ActivityHeatmapWidget` (84-day grid) | `HeatmapWidgetData` (intensities `[Int]` of length 84, userColorHex) | `AppGroup.heatmapDataKey` ("heatmapData") |

- `WidgetDataService.shared` (main app, `@MainActor`) writes JSON-encoded payloads after each run / data change and calls `WidgetCenter.shared.reloadAllTimelines()`.
- Widget code reads via `UserDefaults(suiteName: AppGroup.identifier)`.
- App Group identifier: `group.com.mertmazici.RunDom` — both targets must have the App Groups capability enabled.

## Navigation

- Bottom Tab Bar: Map | Run (center, large button) | Profile | Leaderboard | Stats
- Tab bar always visible except during active run
- Run screen opens as full-screen modal
- Gesture-based navigation preferred over back buttons
- Animations under 0.3s
- Empty state designs for every screen

### Stats Screen
- Past runs list + per-run detail (distance, duration, Points, territories)
- Weekly/monthly summary charts (`ChartView`)
- 84-day calendar heatmap (`RunCalendarHeatmapView` + `CalendarHeatmapCell` + `CalendarHeatmapViewModel`) — same data backing the widget

## Onboarding Flow

1. Splash Screen (logo + Lottie animation, "Runpire" wordmark)
2. Welcome screen (`WelcomeView`)
3. 3 onboarding slides (full-screen, bold typography, mock images)
4. Location permission screen (Always On with explanation)
5. Notification permission screen
6. Sign Up / Sign In (Apple required, Google optional)
7. Complete Profile (if display name missing from Apple Sign In)
- Only shown on first launch (UserDefaults flag)

## Avatar System

- All users share the same avatar character (no custom selection)
- Avatar "talks" to user with personalized messages (emotional engagement)
- Rive integration deferred — use static placeholder image for now
- Future: AI-generated caricature avatars from user photos (Gemini API)

### Rive Details (For Future Implementation)
- State Machine: `Main Animation`
- Boolean inputs: `Talking Animation`, `Sad Animation`, `Happy Animation`

## Notifications (Push via FCM + Local)

- "Your territory was captured"
- "Defense level dropping"
- "Streak about to break" (local, calendar trigger at 20:00)
- "Daily challenge available"
- Deep-link destinations: map, territory detail, profile badges, stats, run history (`AppRouter` still defines a `dropzoneDetail` case — legacy, do not surface)

## Error Handling

- **GPS signal loss:** Run continues, warning shown. Gaps >60s excluded from calculations
- **Offline mode:** Run data stored in CoreData (programmatic model), auto-synced when online via `SyncService` (NWPathMonitor). Territory captures queued separately. Retry up to 5 times per item

## Anti-Cheat & Fairness

- Minimum speed threshold enforcement (`Game.minSpeedKmh = 4.0`)
- GPS anomaly detection (CoreMotion cross-validation)
- Small area farming detection → reduced multiplier
- Circular running in same location → low multiplier
- 48h inactivity → defense decay
- Firestore transactions / Realtime Database for race condition prevention

## Weekly Report

- Total distance, total Points, week-over-week % change
- Territories gained/lost
- Artistic route visualization on map
- Global and neighborhood leaderboards
- Shareable social media format (`PostRunShareCardView` + `RunSummaryShareRenderer`)

## Background Location

**Critical:** During runs, the app may be backgrounded.
- `allowsBackgroundLocationUpdates = true`
- `pausesLocationUpdatesAutomatically = false`
- App Store review requires justification for "Always On" location

## External APIs

| API | Purpose |
|-----|---------|
| Gemini API (Google) | AI caricature avatar generation (future) |
| CLGeocoder (Apple) | Coordinates → neighborhood names (cached in memory) |

## Important Notes

- App brand is **Runpire** in user-facing copy; project + bundle keep the `RunDom` name.
- `FirebaseApp.configure()` is called in `AppDelegate` via `@UIApplicationDelegateAdaptor`
- H3 grid uses custom pseudo-H3 coordinate quantization (not Uber's C library)
- Territory sync uses Realtime Database transactions to prevent race conditions
- Remote Config for all tunable game parameters (speed thresholds, multipliers, zone sizes)
- All game parameters should be server-configurable without app updates
- Every user model includes `isPremium: Bool = true` (everyone gets true for now, StoreKit deferred)
- Offline mode uses programmatic CoreData model (no `.xcdatamodeld` file)
- Lottie animations bundled: `Running_character.json`, `Streak_fire.json`, `Unlocked.json`, `confetti.json`, `run_countdown.json`, `level_up.json`
- Widgets read from App Group `UserDefaults`; always go through `WidgetDataService` so timelines reload.

## Development Roadmap
